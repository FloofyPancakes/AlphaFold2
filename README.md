# ML-In-BioInf-Capstone-Project
Implemention of AlphaFold 2 for backbone protein structure prediction with CASP7 sequence information from SidechainNet. The assignment is broken down into two parts where part 1 consists of building the EvoFormer trunk and predicting the distance matrix of a given sequence. Part 2 consists of using the Evoformer constructed in part 1 to predict the full 3D coordinate structure of C<sub>Î±</sub> Atoms
